Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

Basically, your new AI overachiever.  \n- **Claude Haiku 4.5:** Because why not make AI sound poetic while it manages context on their developer platform? Yes, it’s a thing.\n\nThey emphasize bold innovation paired with “intentional pauses,” which sounds a lot like knowing when to unplug before the robot uprising kicks off.\n\nIf you want to learn, develop, or just poke around their AI playground, Anthropic offers everything from an academy to developer docs. The usual corporate fodder is there too—careers, transparency reports, security, and pricing info.  \n\nIn summary: Anthropic is that ambitious, safety-first AI startup that’s turned AI into a slightly poetic, heavily responsible, and oddly earnest affair."
